# Capítulo 5: Tomar fotografías y vídeos de forma segura e inofensiva

Este capítulo le llevará a través del uso de las características de cámara de fotos y de vídeo integrada de la aplicación móvil/celular

## Instalación 

Antes de que pueda usar la aplicación CameraV, tiene que instalarla. Puede encontrar enlaces de descarga de la aplicación en la siguiente URL web https://guardianproject.info/informa o buscar en Google Play "CameraV". Si instala la aplicación desde fuera de Google Play, mediante descarga de un fichero APK, tendrá que habilitar la opción "(Permitir) Fuentes desconocidas", en su Android en la sección Configuración->Adminitrador del Dispositivo. Una vez haya instalado la aplicación puede deshabilitar la opción "Fuentes desconocidas".

## Configuración de primer-vez

The first-time you use CameraV, you must configure it with basic identity information. The app asks for an identifying name of some sort, which can be your real name or a pseudonum. You can also optionally include an email address, which again, may be your standard email, or a special one you setup just for use with this app. By providing an email address, you ensure that someone who may later find a photo or video captured and shared with CameraV, can contact you.

You must also enter and confirm a password to use with CameraV. This is a new password that is used to protect the photos, video, and sensor metadata stored within the app itself. It is, in a sense, the secret combination for the vault of data the app is protecting.

![password.png](images/password.png)![password2.png](images/password2.png)

Finally, you must take six sample photos with the CameraV app during the setup process. This generates a visual fingerprint of your camera sensor, that can be used later to prove that a specific image or video did or did not come from your camera. The app will ask you to take a "boring" photo, which means a blank wall, table or some other uncomplicated surface. The need for "boring" is a technical detail related to the visual fingerprint process.

Once you complete all of these steps, the setup process is complete, and you will be taken to the CameraV app homescreen.

## Three Essential Views

The CameraV app is compromised of three essential views:

* First is the Home view, which allows you to quickly swipe from left-to-right through the latest captured media. The first-time you run the app, this screen will be empty.
* Second is the Media view. If you tap any image or video preview or thumbnail, you will be taken into a detailed media via that allows you to see the full photo or video, and pinch and zoom the image, or playback and scrub the video. You can also perform operations like share on this screen through menu actionbar commands.
* Third is the Gallery view, which provides thubmnail overview of all captured media, and the ability to filter and sort that media. You can also perform batch share and delete actions through this view.

### The Home View

The Home view is what you are presented with when you enter the app for the first time. It allows you to quickly see the last few media items captured, and swipe through all of them. You can tap on any media preview image to switch to the Media view, which will show the full photo or video.

![home.png](images/home.png)![homeview.png](images/homeview.png)

From this view, is also where you open the camera or navigate to the Gallery view. The three buttons at the bottom of the screen represent Still Camera, Video Camera and Gallery, in that order. The camera buttons open up the camera for capturing media in the indicated formats. The Gallery button opens up the Gallery view for filtering and batch processing of media.

You can also lock the app from the menu option, to sign out, and remove all cached information from memory. The app will then require you to enter a password the next time you open it. Finally, there is also the "Panic Button" action available on this screen, from which you can quickly erase all media and app data from CameraV. We will talk more about all the security capabilities in another chapter.

### The Media View

The Media View, or Detailed View, presents a captured photo or video in it's entirety. You can see the entire photo captured, and pinch and zoom it to get a closer look. You can also rotate your phone into landscape mode, if it is a landscape image. You can watch a video in this view, as well. It may take a few seconds to load, but then you can press play to view the video. You can also drag the playback cursor to scrub, or move frame by frame, through the video.

At the bottom of the view, you will see a "History" section. This is where all actions on the stored media is recorded. This includes when you captured the media file, when you have exported and shared it, and so forth.

At the top of the Media view, you will see three action icons: the Informa View "I", the Share action, and the Edit "Pencil" action.

The Informa View provides full access to the raw sensor metadata captured when you took the picture or recorded the video. It is shown in the "J3M" format you can learn about elsewhere in this guide.

![metadata.png](images/metadata.png)

Tapping on the Share action will reveal three more options: Share Media, Share Metadata and Notarize. 'Share Media' will package up the media file with the metadata, and generate a new JPEG or MPEG-4 file that can be shared with any app, to send via email, post on social media, or upload to a website. 'Share Metadata' will just share the sensor metadata as a plaintext file in the J3M format.

'Notarize' will share a short snippet of text containing the media file's unique visual fingerprint identifier, that can be easily shared via SMS, email, Twitter or some other short message channel. This provides a way to timestamp the media with a third-party, and ensure that any tampering or modification of the media can be later detected.

Tapping on the 'Edit' action will allow you 'Write Text' in order to provide a basic description of what the capture media item is about, or some other context you wish to provide. 'Add Tags' will allow you to place a tag box on the media at a certain place, or time in the case of video. You can then tap on that tag box to enter more detailed information about what it is you were tagging, and why.

You can return to the Home View by pressing the top-left hand back arrow, or by pressing the back key on your device.

### The Gallery

The Gallery view provides a thumbnail view of many media items at once. You can filter media items by type, to see only photos, only videos, or all. You can also select multiple media items for batch operations, by using the checkmark action, or pressing on one item and holding for a few seconds. This will engage the multi-select mode, which allows for multiple items to be selected at once. You can then do a batch export and share action, or delete action. The Share options provided are the same as in the Media view: Share Media, Share Metadata, and Notarize.

## Using the Cameras

From the Home view, you can launch either the Still Camera or the Video Camera. By default, the app will launch the built-in external camera apps that are available on your phone. It will monitor these external camera apps, and when new photos or videos are captured, it will inspect them, extract their metadata, and store a thumnail and the data in the internal encrypted storage. While they will show up in the Gallery view, the actual media file are stored unencrypted in the standard device media storage location on the external memory or SD Card.

To use the encrypted camera capabilities of CameraV, you must go into the CameraV Settings, and uncheck the "Use External Camera Apps" option. Then, the camera action buttons on the Home view will launch the built-in encrypted camera feature. This provides a basic still and video camera capability, with the outputed photo or video file written directly to encrypted storage. This means that only CameraV can see the media, and that if you delete a file it is completely deleted from the device, and not recoverable.

The encrypted camera have only a simple button to take a picture or to stop and start video recording. All other settings are automatic.

When you are done capturing media, you can use the back key to return to the Home view or the Gallery view to see the captured media files.
